Stage 3:\r\n
This stage uses a properly balanced PIN check. When comparing each digit, the\r\n
same number of instructions occur for both correct and incorrect values. It is\r\n
not possible to derive the PIN using a time SCA.\n\r\r
It is still possible to derive the PIN for this stage. If you can demonstrate\r\n
understanding of how to do this without brute force, we may have a special prize\r\n
for you!
