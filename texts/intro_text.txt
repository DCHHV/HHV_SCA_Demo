This is the HHV Timing Side Channel Attack (SCA) demo.\r\n
A time SCA is performed by measuring the time between events that are\r\n
separated by a comparison taking a non-zero amount of time. In this case,\r\n
it is a 4 digit PIN of 4 values. This equates to (4^4)=256 combinations.\n\n\r
To set up: connect the USBee logic analyzer to a computer, start the program\r\n
"pulseview". Pulseview should show "USBee AX" in the middle of the icon bar.\r\n
Select "Configure Channels", enable D0 & D1; select "16 MHz" & "500 G samples".\r\n
This results in ~60 s of acquisition time and ~1 GB of RAM consumption. To save\r\n
RAM, lower the # of samples.\r\n\n
