Stage 1:\r\n
This stage is a poor PIN check. After all 4 digits are input, they are checked\r\n
sequentially. An incorrect digit fails the check instantly. The time between\r\n
the green LED turning off and the red LED flashing varies per the # of\r\n
sequential correct digits.\r\n\n
Pulseview is now to be used. Press "Run", enter PIN, press "Stop".\r\n
Press "Show Cursors" to enable timing markers, measure the time between\r\n
the last rising edge of D1 & the first falling edge of D0; note this time.\r\n
Zoom in to this area to accurately set the markers, and see the time delta.\r\n
Repeat for each unique value of the first digit. One of the times\r\n
noted will be longer than the others. This is the correct value of the first\r\n
digit. Repeat this for each digit pos.\r\r\n
This vuln. reduces the keyspace from (4*4*4*4)=256 to (4+4+4+4)=16.\r\n
Hint: The time delta will keep increasing with more correct digits.\r\n
