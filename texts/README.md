# Texts
Text strings used in the Demo. See `tools/README.md`, `tools/string_packer.c`, and `HHV_SCA_Demo.X/main.c` for information on how these texts are formatted and used.

The `./build-asm.sh` script is provided as a helper function to quickly rebuild the `strings.s` source file used during final assembly of the project
